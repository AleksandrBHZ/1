# Litecoin Upgrade Notes

## July 5th, 2015

 A critical software update for Litecoin Core, version 0.10.2.2 has been released: [[https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=26151.0](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=26151.0)]      

On top of the new features, __this update contains very important security fixes and everyone MUST upgrade to this version as soon as possible__ as details on several vulnerabilities will be made public on July 7th [[Official Bitcoin warning](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/009135.html)].  
   
This update also contains a new consensus rule BIP66, which enforces strict DER encoding for signatures. This rule introduces block version 3 and all miners must update as once 95% of the network has upgraded, __version 2 blocks will be rejected entirely__.
